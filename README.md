When writing a README for a Git repository, including basic configuration information for an Android app, such as Android Gradle Plugin and Gradle version, can be helpful for users. Here's a template you can use as a starting point for your README:

# Project Name

Brief description of the project.

## Requirements

- Android Studio (Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1)
- Android Gradle Plugin (version 7.3.0)
- Gradle (version 7.5)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. **Open** the project in Android Studio.

3. **Configure** the Android Gradle Plugin and Gradle version:
   - Open the **project-level build.gradle** file.
   - Ensure the `build.gradle` file contains the following configurations:

   ```groovy
   buildscript {
       repositories {
           google()
           jcenter()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:X.X.X' // Android Gradle Plugin version
       }
   }
   ```

   - Open the **app-level build.gradle** file.
   - Ensure the `build.gradle` file contains the following configurations:

   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

   android {
       compileSdkVersion X // Specify your desired compile SDK version
       defaultConfig {
           // ...
       }
       // ...
   }

   dependencies {
       // ...
   }

   ```

4. **Sync** the project with Gradle files.

5. **Build** and run the app on your device or emulator.

## Additional Information

## License

Include the license information for your project, if applicable.
